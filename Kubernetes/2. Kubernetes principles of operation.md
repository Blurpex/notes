## Kubernetes from 40K feet
- **Kubernetes cluster** -> 
	- one or more nodes providing CPU, memory, an other resources for use by applications
	- **control plane nodes** -> 
		- implement the K8s intelligence, and every cluster needs at least one
		- includes the API server, scheduler, and the controllers that implement cloud-native features 
		- you should have multiple for high availability
		- must be Linux; cannot be Windows
	- **worker nodes** -> 
		- for running user applications
		- applications can run on control plane as well, but should be run inside a worker node instead

## control plane
- **API server** -> 
	- front end of Kubernetes; all requests to change and query the state of the cluster go through it
	- internal control place services communicate with each other via the API server
	- exposes RESTful API over https, and requests all subjects to authentication and authorization
- **the cluster store** -> 
	- holds the desired state of all applications and cluster components and is the only stateful part of the control plane
	- based on *etcd* distributed database
	- *etcd* prefers an odd number of replicas to help avoid *split brain* conditions where replicas experience communication issues and cannot be sure if they have a majority
- **controller** -> 
	- implements cluster intelligence that all run on control plane
	- most common include deployment, stateful set, replica set controllers
	- also runs a controller manager that is responsible for spawning and managing the individual controllers
- **scheduler** -> 
	- watches the API server for new work tasks and assigns them to healthy worker nodes
	- identifying capable nodes include predicate checks, filtering, and a ranking algorithm, etc

## worker nodes
- **kubelet** -> 
	- main K8s agent and handles all communication with the cluster
	- watches API server for new tasks, instruct appropriate runtime to execute tasks, reports the status of tasks to the API server
- **runtime** -> 
	- most K8s clusters pre-install the *containerd* runtime and use it to execute tasks such as pulling images, managing lifeycle operations such as starting and stopping containers
- **kube-proxy** -> 
	- implements cluster networking and load balances traffic to tasks running on the node

## pod
- smallest unit of K8s; wraps container(s)
- usually only one container exists inside a pod, however multiple container pods can exist such as service meshes - encrypts network traffic coming in and out of the main app, helper services that initialize app environments, apps with tightly couples helper functions such as log scrapers
- each pod is a shared execution environment for one or more containers which includes network stack, volumes, shared memory, and more
- when you scale up and down, you scale pods, not containers
- pods are immutable, if you want to make changes, delete the old one and replace it with the new one

## service objects
- when pods are scaled, new updates are made, pods are assigned new IP addresses
- pods might or might not be there if you call a service by an IP address
- K8s service provide networking for a group of pods, the front end of a service has a DNS name, IP address, and network port and the backend uses labels to load balance traffic across a dynamic set of pods

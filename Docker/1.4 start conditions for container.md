## `CMD`
- sets the default command and/or parameter for the container
- it can be overridden by providing arguments when running the container 
```Dockerfile
# array form
CMD ["executable", "param1", "param2"]
# string form
CMD executable param1 param2
```

## `ENTRYPOINT`
- allows to configure a container that will run as an executable
- the default entrypoint is set as `/bin/sh` and this is passed if no entrypoint is set
```Dockerfile
# array form
ENTRYPOINT ["executable", "param1"]
# string form
ENTRYPOINT executable param1
```
- if `Dockerfile` has both `CMD` and `ENTRYPOINT`, then the `CMD` is used to give default arguments to the `ENTRYPOINT`
```Dockerfile
# this would result in youtube-dl https://imgur.com ..
# link can be overriden by passing as an argument
ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/local/bin/youtube-dl"]
CMD ["https://imgur.com/gallery/xwJgflf"]
```

## images
- `docker search <image>` -> 
	- search for images
	- `OFFICIAL` means the image reviewed by Docker
	- `AUTOMATED` means that the image is built from the source repo
- `docker pull <image>` ->
	- pulls a docker image from the internet
	- by default it pulls the latest image
	- add `:<tag>` after the image name (no space) to get a specified version
- `docker tag ubuntu:18.04 ubuntu:bionic` -> renames `bionic` to `18.04`
- `docker tag ubuntu:18.04 bad_distro:bionic` -> renames `ubuntu` image to `bad_distro`
- an image may consist of 3 parts plus a tag -> 
	- usually `registry/organization/image:tag`
	- if not specified registry will default to `Docker hub`, organization to `library` and tag to `latest`

## building images
- `Dockerfile` ->
	- a file that contains the build instruction for an image
	- example -> 
```bash
#!/bin/sh
echo "Hello, docker!"
```
```yaml
# start from the alpine image
FROM apline:3.13
# the following instructions will be executed in this location
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
# copy hello.sh from host to the working directory in the container
COPY hello.sh .
# give execute permission to the file
RUN chmod +x hello.sh
# this command will run when the container runs
CMD ./hello.sh
```
- `docker build <path> -t <name>` -> 
	- by default Docker will look for a file called `Dockerfile` and build it
	- path should be the location where `Dockerfile` is stored
	- `-t` flag stands for tag and lets you name the image
	- giving a name is suggested, if not given you will need to use to id to reference it
	- you can give a `:<tag>` to version your images
- when you build the image, you will see steps, these steps represent layers ->
	- each step is its own layer
	- layers work as a cache during build time
	- if we've already built an image once and if we edit just the last line, and if we build it again, the build will start from the last line only
	- each step is run inside a container called intermediate container
	- after each step is run, Docker commits commits the changes and repeats until the final image is built

## commands
- `docker cp <path> <container_name>:<path>` -> copies a file in the given host path to the given container and container path
- `docker diff <container_name>` -> 
	- shows what changes has been made to a given container
	- `A` -> added, `D` -> deleted, `C` -> changed
- `docker commit <container_name> <image_name>` -> 
	- commits changes inside a given container to an image
	- this is what an intermediate container does when you build it
	- typically you should not do this, instead use the `Dockerfile` to make any changes

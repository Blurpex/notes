## volumes
- folder that is shared between the host machine and the container
- useful when you want to persist the contents of the container
- with bind mount we can mount a file or directory from host machine into the container
```bash
# host machin : container
docker run -v "$(pwd):/mydir" youtube-dl https://imgur.com/JY5tHqr
```
- mounting a single file is also possible but if the file is not found a directory will be created
```bash
touch text.log
docker run -v "$(pwd)/text.log:/usr/src/app/text.log" simple-web-service
```

## ports
- opening a connection from outside world to a Docker container happens in two steps
	1. exposing port -> tell Docker that the container listens to a certain port
		- add `EXPOST <port>` in `Dockerfile`
	2. publishing port -> Docker will map host ports to the container ports
		- run the container with `-p <host-port>:<container-port>`
```bash
docker run -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 simple-web-service server
```

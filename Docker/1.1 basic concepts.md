## [docker](https://devopswithdocker.com/)
- set of tools to deliver software in packages
- benefits include works on my machine, isolated environments, development, and scaling
## virtual machine
- docker is not a virtual machine
- docker has direct access to kernel and resources
- virtual machines has a Hypervisor between the OS and kernel
## container
- running instance of an image
- can be run on local machines, virtual machines, or deployed on the cloud
- portable and isolated from other containers and runs its own software, binaries, configurations, etc
## image
- a container is provided by an image
- contain everything needed to run an application such as dependencies, configurations, scripts, binaries, etc
- can also contain other configurations such as environment variables, default command to run, and other metadata

## `Dockerfile`
- text-based file with no file extension that contains a script of instructions
- docker uses this script to build container image
```
FROM <image>:<tag>
RUN <install some dependencies>
CMD <command that is executed on `docker container run`>
```
## commands
- `docker pull <image name>:<tag>` downloads given image
- `docker images` -> lists all images
- `docker rmi <image>` -> removes given image
- `docker ps -a` -> list all containers
- `docker run <image>` -> creates and runs a container from an image
- `docker rm <container>` -> removes a given  container
- `docker stop <container>` -> stops a container
- `docker exec <container>` -> executes a command inside the container

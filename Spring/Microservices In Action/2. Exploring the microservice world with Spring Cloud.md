### what is spring cloud?
- **spring cloud** -> group of open source projects that implement the patterns explained in the first chapter
- **spring cloud config** -> handles the management of the application configuration data such as database URL, logging, etc through a centralized service
- **spring cloud service discovery** -> allows services to find and communicate with each other without hard-coding the hostname and port; can be implemented using *Eureka*
- **resilency4j** -> fault tolerance library designed for resiliency patterns such as circuit breakers, retry, rate limit, bulkhead, and more
- **spring cloud load balancer**-> provides client-side load balancing of calls from a service to customer
- **spring cloud gateway** -> proxies service requests and makes sure that all calls to the microservice go through a single *front door* 
- **spring cloud stream** -> lets you easily integrate lightweight message processing with message brokers such as *Kafka* and *RabbitMQ*
- **spring cloud sleuth** -> allows to track a transaction as it flows across the different services
- **spring cloud security** -> authentication and authorization framework that controls who can access services and what they can do with them

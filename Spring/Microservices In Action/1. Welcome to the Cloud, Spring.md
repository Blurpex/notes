## the evolution towards a microservice architecture
- **n-tier architecture** -> with this design, an application is divided into multiple layers, each with their own responsibilities and functions such as a three-tier architecture with a frontend, backend, and database
- **monolithic architecture** -> all of the UI, business, and database logic are packaged together into a unique application and deployed to an application server
- **microservice** -> small, loosely coupled, distributed service where an application logic is broken down into a small-grained components with well defined, coordinate boundaries of responsibility

### cloud & microservice-based applications
- **cloud computing** -> delivery of computing and virtualized IT services - databases, networking, software, servers, analytics, and more - through the internet to provide a flexible, secure, and easy-to-use environment
- **Infrastructure as a Service (Iaas)** -> 
	- the vendor provides the infrastructure that lets you access computing resources such as servers, storage, and networks
	- example -> AWS, Azure, Google Cloud
- **Container as a Service (CaaS)** -> 
	- an intermediate model between the IaaS and the PaaS, it refers to a form of container-based virtualization
	- instead of managing the virtual machine in which your app is deployed, you deploy the app in a lightweight, portable virtual container (Docker) to a cloud provider
	- example -> AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS), Google Container Engine (GKE)
- **Platform as a Service (PaaS)** -> 
	- a platform and an environment that allow users to focus on the development, execution, and maintenance of the application
	- example -> AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google App Engine, Heroku
- **Function as a Service (FaaS)** -> 
	- aka serverless architecture, a way of executing functionalities in the cloud in which the vendor provides all the required servers and allows the developers to focus only on the development of services
	- example -> AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Function, Azure functions
- **Software as a Service (SaaS)** -> 
	- aka software on demand, allows users to use a specific application without having to deploy or maintain
	- everything is managed by the service provider, and the user just hires the service and uses the software
	- example -> Salesforce, SAP, and Google Business

### core microservice development pattern
- the following patterns show the basics of building a microservice -> 
	- **service granularity** -> how do you approach decomposing a business domain down into microservices so that each microservice has a the right level of responsibility
	- **communication protocols** -> how will developers communicate with your service - synchronous vs asynchronous
	- **interface design** -> what's the best way to design the actual service interfaces that developers are going to use to call your service
	- **configuration management of service** -> how do you manage the configuration of your microservice so that it moves between different environments in the cloud
	- **event processing between services** -> how do you decouple your microservice using events so that you minimize hardcoded dependencies between your services and increase the resiliency of your application

### microservice routing patterns
- microservice routing patterns deal with how a client application that wants to consume a microservice discovers the location of the service and is routed over to it -> 
	- **service discovery** -> make your microservice discoverable so client applications can find them without having the location of the service hardcoded into the application
	- **service routing** -> with an API gateway, you can provide a single entry point for all your services so that security policies and routing rules are applied uniformly to multiple services and service instances in your microservice applications

### microservice client resiliency
- microservices need to be able to prevent a problem and cascading up and out to the customers ->
	- **client-side load balancing** -> how do you cache the location of your microservice instances on the service so that calls to multiple instances of a microservice are load balanced to all the health instances of that microservice
	- **circuit breaker pattern** -> how you prevent a client from continuing to call a service that's failing slowly, it consumes resources on the client calling it
	- **fallback pattern** -> when a service call fails, how you provide a "plug-in" mechanism that allows the service client to try to carry out its work through alternative means other than the microservice being called
	- **bulkhead pattern** -> how you compartmentalize calls so that the misbehavior of one service call does not negatively impact the rest of the application
	- 
### microservice logging & tracing patterns
- since microservices are harder to debug, trace, and monitor the issues, logging and tracing are important -> 
	- **log correlation** -> how you tie together all the logs produced between services for a single user transaction
	- **log aggregation** -> how to pull together all of the logs produced by your microservices into a single queryable database across all services involved
	- **microservice tracing** -> how to visualize the flow of a client transaction across all services involved
	
### microservice build/deployment patterns
- **build and deployment pipelines** -> how you create a repeatable build and deployment process that emphasizes one-button builds and deployment to an environment
- **infrastructure as code** -> how you treat the provisioning of your services as code that can be executed and managed under source control
- **immutable serves** -> once a microservice image is created, how you ensure that it's never changed after it's been deployed
- **phoenix servers** -> how you ensure that servers that run individual containers get torn down on a regular basis and re-created from an immutable image

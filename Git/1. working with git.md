## version control system (VCS)
- system that tracks changes to files and directories over time
- allows multiple individuals to collaborate on a project
- provides a structured and organized way to manage and track codebase
- **centralized VCS** -> 
	- central server that stores the repository
	- developers check out from that central repository
	- changes are made locally and then committed back to the server
- **distributed VCS** ->
	- each developer has a copy of the repository
	- allows to work independently

---
## basic configuration
```bash
# set user name
git config --global user.name "Haris Ahmad"
# set email
git config --global user.email harizahmad100@gmail.com
# set the default branch name
git config --global init.defaultBranch main
# set the defeault text editor
git config --global core.editor micro
```

## environments
- **working** ->
	- local file system where you edit, create, or delete files
- **staging** (index) ->
	- temporary space where you prepare and organize changes before committing 

---
## file states
- **untracked** -> 
	- files that have not been staged or committed 
	- git is unaware of these files
- **tracked** ->
	- files that existed in the previous commit
	- tracked files can be in either unmodified, modified, staged, or committed
	- **unmodified** -> files that have not changed since the last commit
	- **modified** -> files that have been changed since the last commit
	- **staged** -> files have been moved to a staging environment

## commands
- **`git init`** ->
	- initializes a git repository
	- creates a directory named `.git` that contains repository files
- **`git clone <url>`** ->
	- copies an existing git repo
	- add a name at the end if you want to name is something else
- **`git add <filename>`** ->
	- stage changes you want to include in the next commit
	- enter `.` to track all files
- **`git commit`** ->
	- add `--amend` to include anything else with the prev commit
- **`git log`** ->
	- shows commit history
	- add `--oneline` to see each log in one line
- **`git status`** -> 
	- determine which files are in which state
- **`git restore <filename>`** ->
	- restore files to the previous commit
	- add `--staged` or `-S` to unstage file(s) 
- **`git rm <filename>`** -> 
	- remove the file from working directory and git automatically moves it to staged
- **`git mv <filename> <new name>`** -> 
	- renames the file and automatically moves it to staging area
- **`git diff`** ->
	- shows the differences since last commit
	- add a commit hash at the end to compare last commit to given commit
- **`git reset <commit hash>`** ->
	- reverts back to the given commit
	- unstages the changes but does not delete or modify them
	- add `--hard` to revert back to the given commit and delete progress
- **`git rebase <branch>/<commit>`** ->
	- TODO: idk whats happening
- **`git branch`** ->
	- lists all the branches
	- add `--delete` or `-d` to delete branch
- **`git switch <branch>`** ->
	- switch to a different branch
	- add `-c` to create the branch if it does not exist
- **`git merge <branch>`** ->
	- merges changes in given branch into current branch
- **`git stash`** ->
	- saves current changes and reverts to last commit
	- add `list` to list all stashes
	- add `apply <#>` to apply the given stash
	- `pop` removes the stash

## ignoring files
- sometimes you do not want git to know about specific files such as sensitive information, system files, node modules, etc
- **`.gitignore`** ->
	- file used by git to specify files and directories that should be ignored
```.gitignore
*.log
node_modules
.vscode/
```

	### instance stores
- block level storage volumes behave like physical hard drives
- **instance store** -> provides temporary block-level storage for an EC2 instance and has the lifespan of the instance
- **Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS)** -> service that provides block-level storage volumes that you can use with EC2 instances, and it persists independent of the instance
- **EBS snapshots** -> an increment backup meaning that the first backup taken of a volume copies all the data and for any subsequent backups, only the changed data will be saved

### simple storage service
- **object** -> data such as document, image, etc
- **bucket** -> folder that holds objects
- **Amazon S3** -> service that provides object-level storage; stores data as objects in buckets
- S3 storage classes ->
	1. **S3 standard** -> 
		- designed for frequently accessed data
		- stores data in a minimum of three availability zones
	2. **S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (Standard IA)** -> 
		- ideal for infrequently accessed data but requires higher availability when needed
		- lower storage price but higher retrieval price compared to standard
	3. **S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (One Zone-IA)** -> 
		- stores data in a single availability zone
		- has a lower storage price than standard IA
	4. **S3 Intelligent-Tiering** -> 
		- ideal for data with unknown or changing access patterns
		- if you have not accessed an object for 30 days, S3 automatically moves it to Standard-IA, and if you use access an object in infrequent tier, S3 automatically moves it to standard
		- requires a small monthly monitoring and automation fee per object
	5. **S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval** -> 
		 - works well for archived data that requires immediate access
		 - same performance as S3 standard
	6. **S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval** -> 
		- low cost storage designed for data archiving
		- able to retrieve objects withing a few minutes to hours
	7. **S3 Glacier Deep Retrieval** -> 
		- lowest cost object storage class ideal for archiving
		- able to retrieve objects within 12 hours

### block storage vs object storage
- block storage saves changes only meaning it will take less time to upload compared to object storage that saves the entire object no matter how big or small the change is
- block storage can hold up to 16 TiB at once, whereas S3 is unlimited
- block storage can persists the EC2 lifecycle and object storage is serverless

### file storage
- in file storage multiple clients can access data that is stored in shared file folders
- in this approach, a storage server uses block storage with a local file system to organize files
- **Amazon Elastic File System (EFS)** -> 
	- scalable file system used with AWS cloud services
	- it can scale according to demand
	- stores data across multiple availability zones

### databases
- **relational database** -> data is stored in a way that relates it to other pieces of data
- **Amazon Relational Database System (RDS)** -> 
	- service that enables you to run relational databases in the cloud
	- automates tasks such as hardware provisioning, database setup, patching, and backups
	- provides Amazon Aurora (proprietary MySQL and PostgreSQL), PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle Database, and Microsoft SQL server
- **non-relational database** -> key-value based tables
- **Amazon DynamoDB** -> 
	- key-value database service
	- delivers single-digit millisecond performance at any scale
	- serverless meaning you don't have to provision, patch, or manage server
	- automatically scales according to demand
- **data warehouse** -> practice of collecting data from a wide range of sources withing a company into a single database that may be used to guide management decisions
- **Amazon Redshift** -> 
	- data warehousing service used for big data analytics
	- offers ability to collect data from many sources 
- **Amazon Database Migration Service (DMS)** -> 
	- enables you to migrate databases from on premises to cloud
	- during migration, the source database remains operational
	- source and target database can be of different types
- **Amazon DocumentDB** -> document based database service that supports MongoDB workloads
- **Amazon Neptune** -> graph based database service
- **Amazon Quantum Ledger Database** -> ledger database service
- **Amazon Managed Blockchain** -> service that creates and manages blockchain networks
- **Amazon ElastiCache** -> service that adds caching layers on top of your databases to help improve the read times of common requests; supports Redis and Memcached
- **Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX)** -> an in-memory cache for DynamoDB

### Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)
- provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud as EC2 instances 
### EC2 instance types
1. **general purpose** -> provides a balance of compute, memory, and networking resources
2. **compute optimized** -> ideal for compute-bound applications that benefit from high-performance processors
3. **memory optimized** -> designed to deliver fast performance for workloads that process large datasets in memory
4. **accelerated computing** -> use hardware accelerators to perform some functions more efficiently that is possible in software running on CPUs
5. **storage optimized** -> designed for workloads that require high, sequential read and write access to large datasets on local storage
### EC2 pricing
1. **on-demand**:
	- ideal for short-term, irregular workloads that cannot be interrupted
	- no upfront costs or minimum contracts apply
2. **reserved** -> 
	- billing discount applied to the use of on-demand instance in your account
	- two types of reserved instances:
		1. **standard reserved** -> when you know what you want; required to state instance type and size, platform description (operating system), tenancy (default or dedicated)
		2. **convertible reserved** -> when you need to run instances in different zones or different instance types, generally more expensive than standard reserved
	- at the end of the reserved term, you can continue using the EC2 but you will be charged on-demand rates until you terminate or renew
3. **instance saving plans** -> 
	- reduces costs when you make an hourly spend commitment to an instance family and region for 1 year or 3 year term.
	- any usage beyond the commitment is charged at on-demand rate
	- no need to specify up front what instance types, size, OS, and tenancy
4. **spot** -> 
	- ideal for workloads with flexible start and end times, or that can withstand interruptions
	- spot instances are unused EC2 computing capacity and offer you cost savings up to 90% off on-demand prices
	- the process won't start unless there is unused capacity available, it might interrupt in between as well
5. **dedicated host** -> 
	- physical servers that is fully dedicated to the user

### scaling EC2
- **scaling** involved beginning with only the resources you need and designing your architecture to automatically respond to changing demand by scaling out or in
- **Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling** -> 
	- service that enables you to automatically add or remove EC2 instances in response to changing application demand
	- two approaches to scale automatically -> 
		1. **dynamic scaling** -> scaling responds to changing demands
		2. **predictive scaling** -> automatically schedules the right number of EC2 instances based on predicted demands
	- creating a Auto Scaling group -> 
		1. set minimum capacity which which is the number of EC2 instances that launch immediately after you have created the Auto Scaling group
		2. set desired capacity, if you don't specify the desired number, it will default to minimum capacity
		3. set maximum capacity which is the maximum number of instances allowed
### directing traffic
 - **Elastic Load Balancing** -> AWS service that automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple resources such as EC2 instances
 - a load balancer acts as a single point of contact for all incoming web traffic to your Auto Scaling group

### messaging and queuing
- **Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS)** -> 
	- publish/subscribe service, using SNS topics, a publisher publishes a message to subscribers
	- subscribers can be web servers, email addresses, etc
- **Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS)** -> 
	- message queuing service that can send, store, and receive messages between software components without losing messages or requiring other services to be available
	- in SQS, an application sends messages into a queue, then a user or service retrieves a message from the queue, processes it, and then deleted it from the queue

### serverless computing
- **serverless** -> code run on servers, but you do not need to provision or manage these servers. Another benefit of serverless is that it scales automatically
- **AWS Lambda** -> an AWS service for serverless computing, you are only charged when the code is running

### containers
- **containers** -> provide you with a standard way to package your application's code and dependencies into a single object
- **Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS)** -> container management system that enables you to run and scale containerized applications on AWS
- **Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)** -> amazon service that you can use to run Kubernetes on AWS
- **AWS Fargate** -> serverless compute engine for containers which works with both ECS and EKS

### connectivity to AWS
- **Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** -> 
	- a networking service that establishes boundaries around AWS services
	- **subnet** -> section of VPC that can contain resources such as EC2 (more below)
	- within a VPC, you can organize resources into subnets
- **internet gateway** -> allows public traffic from the internet to access VPC
- **virtual private gateway** -> 
	- enables you to access private resources in a VPC
	- allows traffic into VPC only if its coming from an approved network
- **AWS Direct Connect** -> 
	- establishes a dedicated private connection between personal data center and a VPC
	- allows you to directly access VPC without needing to get on the public internet

### subnets & network access control lists
- **subnet** -> section of VPC in which you can group resources based on security or operational needs
	- **public subnet** -> contains resources that need to be accessible by the public
	- **private subnet** -> contains resources that should be accessible only through your private network
	- in a VPC, subnets can communicate with each other
- **network ACLs** -> 
	- virtual firewall that controls inbound and outbound traffic at the subnet level 
	- **packet** -> a unit of data sent over the internet or a network
	- **stateless packet filtering** -> network ACLs are stateless meaning that they remember nothing and check packets both ways
	- by default, allows all traffic
- **security groups** -> 
	- a virtual firewall that controls inbound and outbound traffic for an EC2 instance
	- **stateful packet filtering** -> security groups are stateful meaning they remember previous decisions made for incoming traffic
	- by default denies all inbound traffic and allows all outbound traffic

### global networking
- **domain name system (DNS)** -> phone book of the internet
- **DNS resolution** -> process of translating a domain name into an IP address
- **Amazon Route 53** -> DNS web service; manages DNS records

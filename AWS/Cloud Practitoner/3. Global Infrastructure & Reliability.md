### regions
- AWS has multiple data centers all around the world to maintain high availability
- when determining the right region, consider these factors ->
	1. compliance -> data governance and legal requirements
	2. proximity -> select region closer to your customer to deliver content faster
	3. functionality -> closest region might not have all the features
	4. pricing -> some regions might have higher cost due to laws or other factors

### availability zones
- **availability zone** -> 
	- a single data center or a group of data centers within a region
	- data centers in a zone are close enough to have low latency and far enough to reduce the in case a disaster occurs
	- best practice to run instances in multiple zones in a region 

### edge locations
- **edge location** -> site that Amazon CloudFront uses to store cached copies of your content closer too your customers for faster delivery
- **Amazon CloudFront** -> content delivery network (CDN) service that accelerates the delivery of websites, APIs, static content, and other web assets by caching them at edge locations closer to customers/users
- **AWS Outposts** -> extend AWS infrastructure and services to different locations including your own on-premises data center

### interacting with AWS
- **AWS management console** -> web-based interface for accessing and managing AWS services
- **AWS command line interface** -> enables you to control multiple AWS services directly from the command line within one tool
- **software development kits (SDK)** -> make it easier to use AWS services with your existing applications 
- **AWS Elastic Beanstalk** -> with Beanstalk, you provide code and configuration settings and Beanstalk deploys the resources necessary to perform various tasks such as adjusting capacity, load balancing, automatic scaling, health monitoring, etc
- **AWS CloudFormation** -> infrastructure as code, build environment by writing lines of code instead of using the management console

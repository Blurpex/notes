### AWS cloud adoption framework
- **AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (AWS CAF)** -> 
	- guidance resource to assist organizations in effectively migrating to and adopting cloud computing
	- organizes guidance into six areas of focus, called **Perspectives**
	- each perspective addresses distinct responsibilities -> 
		- **business perspective** -> 
			- ensures that IT aligns with business needs and that IT investments link to key business results
			- use this perspective to create a strong business case for cloud adoption
			- common roles include business managers, finance managers, budget owners, and strategy stakeholders
		- **people perspective** -> 
			- supports development of an organization-wide change management strategy for successful cloud adoption
			- this helps prioritize training, staffing, and organizational changes
			- common roles include human resources, staffing, and people managers
		- **governance perspective** ->
			- focuses on the skills and processes to align IT strategy with business strategy
			- manage and measure cloud investments to evaluate business outcomes
			- common roles include chief information officer, program managers, enterprise architect, business analyst, portfolio managers
		- **platform perspective** -> 
			- include principles and patterns for implementing new solutions on the cloud, and migrating on-premises workloads to the cloud
			- describe the architect of the target state environment in detail
			- common roles include chief technology officer, IT managers, solutions architect
		- **security perspective** -> 
			- ensures that the organization meets security objectives for visibility, audit-ability, control, and agility
			- structure the selection and implementation of security controls that meet the organizational needs
			- common roles includes chief information security officer, IT security managers, IT security analysts
		- **operations perspective** -> 
			- helps you to enable, run, use, operate, and recover IT workloads to the level agreed upon with your business stakeholders
			- define current operating procedures and identify the process changes and training needed to implement successful cloud operation
			- common roles include IT operations managers and IT support managers

### 6 strategies for migration
- **rehosting** -> also known as *lift-and-shift* involves moving applications without changes
- **replatforming** -> also known as *lift, tinker, and shift* involves making a few cloud optimizations to realize a tangible benefit
- **refactoring/re-architecting** -> involves reimagining how an application is architected and developed by using cloud-native features
- **repurchasing** -> involves moving from a traditional license to a software-as-a-service model
- **retaining** -> consists of keeping applications that are critical for the business in the source environment
- **retiring** -> process of removing application that are no longer needed

### snow family
- **AWS Snow Family** -> collection of physical devices that help you physically transport up to exabytes of data into and out of AWS
- **AWS Snowcone** -> 
	- small, rugged, and secure edge computing and data transfer device
	- features 2 CPUs, 4GB of memory, and up to 14 TB of usable storage
- **AWS Snowball** -> 
	- **Snowball Edge Storage Optimized** -> 
		- devices that are well suited for large-scale data migrations and recurring transfer workflow, in addition to local computing and higher capacity needs
		- 80 TB of HDD, 1 TB of SSD, 40 vCPUs, 80 GiB memory
	 - **Snowball Edge Compute Optimized** -> 
		 - provdes powerful computing resources for use cases such as machine learning, full motion video analysis, analytics and local computing stacks
		 - 80 TB HDD, 28 TB NVMe SSD, 104 vCPUs, 416 GiB memory, optional NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU
	 - **AWS Snowmobile** -> 
		 - exabyte-scale data transfer service used to move large amounts of data to AWS
		 - transfer up to 100 petabytes of data per Snowmobile, a 45 foot long shipping container pulled by a semi trailer truck

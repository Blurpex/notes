### AWS well-architected framework
- **AWS well-architected** -> helps you understand how to design and operate reliable, secure, efficient, and cost-effective systems in the AWS cloud
- based on six pillars -> 
	- **operational excellence** -> ability to run and monitor systems to deliver business value and to continually improve supporting processes and procedures
	- **security** -> ability to protect information, systems, and assets while delivering business value though risk assessments and mitigation strategies
	- **reliability** -> ability of a system to recover from disruptions, acquire computing resources to meet demand, and mitigate disruptions
	- **performance efficiency** -> ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes
	- **cost optimization** -> ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point
	- **sustainability** -> ability to improve sustainability impacts by reducing energy consumption and increasing efficiency across all components of a workload by maximizing the benefits from the provisioned resources and minimizing the total resources required

### [shared responsibility model](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/)
- both AWS and the customer is responsible for securing the resources
- **shared responsibility model** -> 
	- divides responsibilities into customer (security *in* the cloud) and AWS (security *of* the cloud)
	- AWS is responsible for protecting the infrastructure that runs all of the services offered in the AWS cloud; the infrastructure is composed of hardware, software, networking, and facilities that run the AWS services
	- customers are responsible for operating system, networks, firewall configuration, data, applications, etc
	- some shared controls include patch management, configuration management, and training

### user permissions and access
- **AWS Identity & Access Management (IAM)** -> 
	- manages access to AWS services and resources securely
	- gives you the flexibility to configure access based on your company's specific operational and security needs
- **AWS account root user** -> 
	- when you create an AWS account, you begin with an identity known as root user
	- the root user has complete access to all AWS services and resources in that account
	- do not use root user for everyday tasks
- **IAM users** -> 
	- IAM user is an identity that you create; it represents the person or application that interacts with AWS services and resources
	- by default, and IAM user has no permissions
- **IAM policies** -> 
	- document that allows or denies permissions to AWS services or resources
	- enables you to customize users' levels of access to resources
	- follow the security principle of least privilege when granting permissions
- **IAM groups** ->  collection of IAM users that are granted permissions specified by the policy
- **IAM roles** -> 
	- identity that you can assume to gain temporary access to permissions
	- ideal for situations in which access to services or resources need to be granted temporarily instead of long term
	- when someone assumes an IAM role, they abandon all previous permissions

### organizations
- **AWS organizations** -> 
	- helps to manage multiple AWS accounts with a central location
	- automatically creates a root account which is the parent container for all accounts
	- **service control policies (SCP)** -> centrally control permissions for the accounts in an organization and place restrictions that users and roles in each account can access
	- **organizational units** -> you can group accounts into organizational units (OUs) to make it easier to manage accounts with business or security requirements

### compliance
- **AWS Artifact** -> 
	- service that provides on-demand access to AWS security and compliance reports and select online agreements
	- consists of two parts ->
		- **AWS Artifact Agreements** -> review, accept, and manage agreements for an individual account and for all your accounts in the AWS Organization
		- **AWS Artifact Reports** -> provides compliance reports from third-party auditors

### denial-of-service attacks
- **denial-of-service (DoS) attack** -> deliberate attempt to make a website or application unavailable to users
- **distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack** -> multiple sources are used to start an attack that aims to make a website or application unavailable
- **AWS Shield** -> 
	- service that protects applications against DDoS attacks 
	- provides two levels of protections ->
		- **AWS Shield Standard** -> automatically protects all AWS customers at no cost; protects from most common attacks
		- **AWS Shield Advanced** -> paid service that provides detailed attack diagnosis and the ability to detect and mitigate sophisticated DDoS attacks

### additional security services
- **AWS Key Management Service (KMS)** -> 
	- perform encryption operations through the use of cryptographic keys 
	- create,  manage, and use cryptographic keys
	- choose specific levels of access control for users and roles
- **AWS WAF** -> 
	- web application firewall that lets you monitor network requests that come into your web applications
	- **web access control list** -> WAF uses web ACL to block or allow traffic
- **Amazon inspector** -> 
	- performs automatic security assessments, checks for security vulnerabilities and deviations from security best practices 
	- provides a list of security findings prioritized by severity level
- **Amazon GuardDuty** -> 
	- service that provides intelligent threat detection for your AWS infrastructure and resources
	- identifies threat by continuously monitoring the network activity and account behavior

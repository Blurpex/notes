### deployment models for cloud computing
- **cloud-based deployment** -> 
	- run all parts of the application in the cloud
	- migrate existing application to the cloud
	- design and build new applications in the cloud
- **on-premises deployment** (private cloud deployment)-> 
	- deploy resources by using virtualization and resource management tools
	- increase resource utilization by using application management and virtualization technologies
- **hybrid deployment** -> 
	- connect cloud-based resources to on-premises infrastructure
	- integrate cloud-based resources with legacy IT applications
### benefits of cloud computing
- trade upfront expense for variable expense
- stop spending money to run and maintain data centers
- stop guessing capacity
- benefit from massive economics of scale
- increase speed and agility
- go global in minutes

## a time when you saved the day / solved a big problem
#### hack-a-thon
- I attended a hackathon hosted by IEEE last spring. I went with my two of my friends as a team, one of them was a IT major and the other one was a computer science major. The first half of the competition was solving a set of algorithmic problems. It ranged from beginner level to difficult level and we breezed past it easily since that was our domain. 
- Then came the second part of the competition was entirely about circuits. Among us I was the only one who had taken a course and a half in electric engineering. Since we were inexperienced we weren't able to solve the problems the fastest but we were able to finish most of them on time. However, we did manage to finish one of them the second fastest, if I remember correctly it was displaying letters on a LED matrix one by one. 
- At the end my team finished second just a few points behind the first team. I personally was very proud because I was able to fill gap that my team lacked and I managed to make the most of the limited knowledge I had.

## disagreement, difficult person, conflict
#### capstone
- One of the difficult challenges I faced was during my capstone project. Our team had came up with a plan on what we wanted to do, what technologies we wanted to utilize, and allocated about a month time to learn these technologies. My team had split responsibilities, with two members working on the frontend and me and my partner working on the backend and database. Initially we took a relaxed approach to management with everyone working at their own pace and meeting once a week to discuss progress and problems we faced. 
- About halfway through me and my partner were done with most of the big tasks, but the frontend team had not made much progress. So in the next meeting, I approached them and ask about the lack of progress, and through this discussion I learned that they were not familiar with the technologies we were utilizing such as Stripe for payment handling and oauth for authentication. They had not learned these technologies in the time they were given and that was harming the team and that left me feeling frustrated. 
- Instead of expressing my frustration I took the initiative by scheduling more frequent meetings and assigning specific tasks for each member. I also took on tasks that they were not familiar with leaving them with tasks that they were familiar with. Thankfully, we were able to finish the project in time.
- Although it was a challenging time, I learned the importance of communication from the get go. By taking on more tasks I learned a lot more than I had planned on. This experience also helped me realize my ability to lead during difficult times. 
#### react vs angular
- During my capstone project, we encountered a disagreement when deciding on the technology stack for our frontend development. It wasn't a heated conflict, but rather a mismatch of opinions regarding whether we should use React or Angular.
- I advocated for Angular due to its comprehensive feature set. Angular provides everything out of the box, which means there’s no need to install third-party packages. It is particularly beneficial for beginners as it follows a more opinionated approach, preventing developers from deviating into bad practices. Additionally, Angular uses TypeScript and is compiled, which helps catch errors before they reach production.
- On the other hand, my teammates preferred React because they were already familiar with it and found functional components more convenient than class components. They valued the flexibility and simplicity that React offers, which they felt would make the development process smoother and faster given their existing knowledge.
- Although, I still believe Angular is the better choice, I recognized that learning a completely new framework could be inefficient and potentially delay our project. To resolve the disagreement, we decided to split our responsibilities based on our strengths. My partner and I focused on the backend and database, while the other two team members worked on the frontend using React. This way, we could all work efficiently and capitalize on our existing knowledge.
- This experience taught me the importance of flexibility and compromise in a team setting. By understanding and valuing my teammates’ perspectives, we were able to make a decision that benefited the entire project.

## a time you messed up or failed
#### calculus 3
- I was coming off a strong academic year—I had a 4.0 GPA, received an award for my academic performance, and I was feeling confident. I was taking calculus 3 that semester, I went into the first exam feeling like I didn’t need to study as much as usual, assuming it would be straightforward. I ended up barely passing that exam, which shook me. I promised myself I would prepare better next time.
- Then, just two weeks before the second exam, it was during the covid era, I unfortunately caught covid, and I missed several important lectures. Still, I had to take the exam without fully understanding the material, and I failed. Having never failed a class before, I was panicking and I felt the pressure mounting on me. Still I was determined not to let this setback define my semester, I began visiting my professor, Dr. Grosh, every week for extra help. I worked through every exercise in the textbook, I made sure I fully understood the concepts.
- When it was time for the final, I went in as prepared as I could be, and it paid off, I scored really well. I finished the course with a C, it wasn’t the grade I’d hoped for, I was proud of it because it represented resilience and hard work. The next semester I went to look at my exam paper, Dr. Grosh told me I had earned the second-highest score on the final. This experience taught me that setbacks do not have to define my success and that I can always bounce back stronger.

## a time when you had to work in a team
#### capstone
- Let me tell you about my capstone project—it was one of the best experiences I've had working in a team of four.
- At the beginning, we followed a structured approach, following the software development life cycle. We planned our project and proposed it to our advisor and made changes based on his feedback. Then we moved to the next step, we worked on the requirement analysis phase by filing a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document. For the design phase, we specified the technologies we wanted to use, I created entity relationship diagram, and my team worked on the robustness diagrams, and a storyboard.
- During the initial implementation phase, we divided the work according to our strengths. I partnered with another student to handle the backend and database, while the other two focused on the frontend. We kept our weekly meetings since the two teams were working independently and we were progressing at out own pace.
- However, as we moved deeper into the project, we had to start integrating the frontend with the backend, and that’s when things had to change. Meeting once a week was no longer sufficient. We faced several hurdles, and it became clear that our initial structured waterfall method wasn't flexible enough for the integration challenges we were encountering. We were falling behind and needed to scramble to get everything done.
- We decided to increase our communication frequency, holding daily check-ins to ensure alignment between the teams. This change was crucial for our progress. We also helped each other out whenever someone was unfamiliar with a particular technology.
- For the final presentation, each team member was responsible for presenting the feature they developed. I presented the voice ordering feature I built, explaining it in simple terms to an audience that wasn't tech-savvy. 
- The whole experience taught me the importance of flexibility and adaptability in a team. What worked at the start of the project didn't necessarily work later on, but being willing to adjust helped us succeed in the end.
#### fifa project
- During my application programming course in college, we had to develop an Android app as our main project. I partnered with another student, and since we both shared a passion for soccer and gaming, we decided to create a FIFA 22 player tracking app.
- Our goal was to build an app where users could browse FIFA 22 players, track their stats, and save their favorites. We needed to create a fully functional Android application with a clean user interface and backend within a semester
- I took ownership of the backend development while my teammate handled the frontend. For my part, I sourced player data from Kaggle, cleaned it up, and implemented an SQLite database to store everything. I also built multi-threading functionality to keep the app running smoothly while handling database operations.
- We set up two meetings every week to sync up on progress and tackle challenges together. The biggest hurdle we faced was dealing with Android's deprecated features since we were using Java instead of Kotlin. We actually decided to use Git for version control - it was our first time using it in a real project setting. Though we had some hiccups, like having to create a new repository after a major Git mistake, it taught us valuable lessons about collaborative development.
- What really made our partnership work was how we played to each other's strengths. While I focused on the data and logic, my teammate created a beautiful interface using Material Design principles and handled all the complex navigation.
- We successfully delivered a fully functional app and presented it to our class. The project not only met all the course requirements but also gave us real-world experience in team development. I learned a ton about database implementation and multi-threading, but more importantly, I gained practical experience with version control and collaborative development. Looking back, those Git mistakes actually helped us understand how real development teams work together.

## prioritize/organize work
- When it comes to organizing work/tasks, I rely on to-do list that categorize tasks based on their importance and deadlines. I also consider the complexity of the tasks, tackling simpler ones first to build momentum and allocating more time for difficult tasks.
- For example, in my coursework, I prioritized assignments based on their due dates and difficulty level. For challenging courses, I allocated extra study time to ensure I understood the material thoroughly, while efficiently managing easier subjects to maintain a balanced workload.
- Sometimes there are conflicts or multiple tasks that need to be achieved simultaneously. In such cases, I believe it's best to communicate proactively if there are any conflicts. If I'm reporting to two professors or supervisors with a single deadline, I ensure both of them are aware of my progress and any potential conflicts. I communicate openly with both parties to find a balanced solution that aligns with the goals and deadlines.

## adapt to new situation/environment
#### moving to new country
- I have had the unique experience of growing up in different countries which made me adapt to new environments multiple times. I was born in Pakistan, and my first major transition came when my family moved to Nepal during my early school years. I went to an international school there, so you could get by with just English, but, my parents encouraged me to fully integrate into the local culture, including learning Nepali. This was particularly challenging because I was the only international student taking this approach. Looking back, I realize how significant this was – while other international students stayed within their comfort zones, I pushed myself to connect with the local community. As a result, I became fluent in Nepali and formed deep friendships and I still talk to some of them to this day.
- Then came an even bigger challenge – moving to the United States. The transition from Nepal to the USA was much more challenging than moving to Nepal culturally wise. I was comfortable with English, but the American culture was completely different from what I had expected. For example, people are a lot more friendly here, schools here have so many rules but are less strict, and it took some time for my taste buds to adjust. Building on what I learned from my experience, I took an active approach to integration. I joined school clubs, participated in extracurricular activities, and I put myself in situations where I could learn about American culture firsthand.
- Over time, I successfully assimilated to the American culture. This journey has made me fluent in five languages and given me a deep appreciation for different cultures. It has made adapting to new environments like second nature to me.

## new idea
#### unique capstone project
- for our capstone, we had to pick a project, there were two choices either pick a sponsored project or you could propose your own. my team did not like any of the projects that were available. My team came up with some ideas, one of them was restaurant management system. we chose this because we would have to build a full stack application and we would have learned a lot from that. another thing we liked about it was that we could turn it into a business later on.
- we proposed this idea to our advisor, he wasn't convinced saying that it was too similar to other products such as Uber Eats and DoorDash. We really wanted to keep working on this, so we had to show that our project was unique and different from other services.
- One thing we noticed was that the existing services focused on the customer, not the restaurant owners. so we decided to build on that and make the restaurant owners the center of attention. the owners would set up either a kiosk or a qr linking to the website for customers to order. then we would collect this data and turn it into actionable insights. for example best selling item by the day of the week, total sales in a time range, and much more. the owners can use this data to grow their business. 
- another benefit was that our product would automate orders which meant restaurants did not have to rely on dedicated servers, and that would be very beneficial especially for small scale restaurants. however this raised another issue, people would rather talk to a server, so we decided to use natural language processing to build a feature where you can order using your voice simulating talking to a real server.

## a situation where you had to give someone bad news
If you could give people from your high school one piece of advice about anything (life, school, or career) that you’ve learned since high school, what would you tell them?
## a time you had to lead

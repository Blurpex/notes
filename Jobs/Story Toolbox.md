## a time when you saved the day / solved a big problem
#### hack-a-thon
- I attended a hackathon hosted by IEEE last spring. I went with my two of my friends as a team, one of them was a IT major and the other one was a computer science major. The first half of the competition was solving a set of algorithmic problems and we breezed past it easily since that was our domain. 
- Then came the second part of the competition was entirely about circuits. Among us I was the only one who had taken a course and a half in electric engineering. Since we were inexperienced we weren't able to solve the problems the fastest but we were able to finish most of them on time. However we did manage to finish one of them the second fastest, if I remember correctly it was displaying letters on a LED matrix one by one. 
- At the end my team finished second just a few points behind the first team. I personally was very proud because I was able to fill gap that my team lacked and I managed to make the most of the limited knowledge I had.

## a time when you worked with a difficult person & how you handled it
#### capstone
- One of the difficult challenges I faced was during my capstone project. Our team had came up with a plan on what we wanted to do, what technologies we wanted to utilize, and allocated about a month time to learn these technologies. My team had split responsibilities, with two members working on the frontend and me and my partner working on the backend and database. Initially we took a relaxed approach to management with everyone working at their own pace and meeting once a week to discuss progress and problems we faced. 
- About halfway through me and my partner were done with most of the big tasks, but the frontend team had not made much progress. So in the next meeting, I approached them and ask about the lack of progress, and through this discussion I learned that they were not familiar with the technologies we were utilizing such as Stripe for payment handling and oauth for authentication. They had not learned these technologies in the time they were given and that was harming the team and that left me feeling frustrated. 
- Instead of expressing my frustration I took the initiative by scheduling more frequent meetings and assigning specific tasks for each member. I also took on tasks that they were not familiar with leaving them with tasks that they were familiar with. 
- Although it was a challenging time, I learned the importance of communication from the get go. By taking on more tasks I learned a lot more. This experience also helped me realize my ability to lead during difficult times. 
## a time you messed up or failed
#### calculus 3
- I was coming off a strong academic year—I had a 4.0 GPA, received an award for my academic performance, and I was feeling confident. I was taking calculus 3 that semester, I went into the first exam feeling like I didn’t need to study as much as usual, assuming it would be straightforward. I ended up barely passing that exam, which shook me. I promised myself I would prepare better next time.
- Then, just two weeks before the second exam, it was during the covid era, I unfortunately caught covid, and I missed several important lectures. Still, I had to take the exam without fully understanding the material, and I failed again. Having never failed a class before, I was panicking and I felt the pressure mounting on me. Still I was determined not to let this setback define my semester, I began visiting my professor, Dr. Grosh, every week for extra help. I worked through every exercise in the textbook, I made sure I fully understood the concepts.
- When it was time for the final, I went in as prepared as I could be, and it paid off, I scored really well. I finished the course with a C, it wasn’t the grade I’d hoped for, I was proud of it because it represented resilience and hard work. The next semester I went to look at my exam paper, Dr. Grosh told me I had earned the second-highest score on the final. This experience taught me that setbacks do not have to define my success and that I can always bounce back stronger.
## situation where you had to give someone bad news
## disagreement or mismatch of opinions
#### react vs angular
- During my capstone project, we encountered a disagreement when deciding on the technology stack for our frontend development. It wasn't a heated conflict, but rather a mismatch of opinions regarding whether we should use React or Angular.
- I advocated for Angular due to its comprehensive feature set. Angular provides everything out of the box, which means there’s no need to install third-party packages. It is particularly beneficial for beginners as it follows a more opinionated approach, preventing developers from deviating into bad practices. Additionally, Angular uses TypeScript and is compiled, which helps catch errors before they reach production.
- On the other hand, my teammates preferred React because they were already familiar with it and found functional components more convenient than class components. They valued the flexibility and simplicity that React offers, which they felt would make the development process smoother and faster given their existing knowledge.
- Although, I still believe Angular is the better choice, I recognized that learning a completely new framework could be inefficient and potentially delay our project. To resolve the disagreement, we decided to split our responsibilities based on our strengths. My partner and I focused on the backend and database, while the other two team members worked on the frontend using React. This way, we could all work efficiently and capitalize on our existing knowledge.
- This experience taught me the importance of flexibility and compromise in a team setting. By understanding and valuing my teammates’ perspectives, we were able to make a decision that benefited the entire project.

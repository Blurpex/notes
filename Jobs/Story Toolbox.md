## a time when you saved the day / solved a big problem
#### hack-a-thon
- I attended a hackathon hosted by IEEE last spring. I went with my two of my friends as a team, one of them was a IT major and the other one was a computer science major. The first half of the competition was solving a set of algorithmic problems and we breezed past it easily since that was our domain. 
- Then came the second part of the competition was entirely about circuits. Among us I was the only one who had taken a course and a half in electric engineering. Since we were inexperienced we weren't able to solve the problems the fastest but we were able to finish most of them on time. However we did manage to finish one of them the second fastest, if I remember correctly it was displaying letters on a LED matrix one by one. 
- At the end my team finished second just a few points behind the first team. I personally was very proud because I was able to fill gap that my team lacked and I managed to make the most of the limited knowledge I had.

## disagreement, difficult person, conflict
#### capstone
- One of the difficult challenges I faced was during my capstone project. Our team had came up with a plan on what we wanted to do, what technologies we wanted to utilize, and allocated about a month time to learn these technologies. My team had split responsibilities, with two members working on the frontend and me and my partner working on the backend and database. Initially we took a relaxed approach to management with everyone working at their own pace and meeting once a week to discuss progress and problems we faced. 
- About halfway through me and my partner were done with most of the big tasks, but the frontend team had not made much progress. So in the next meeting, I approached them and ask about the lack of progress, and through this discussion I learned that they were not familiar with the technologies we were utilizing such as Stripe for payment handling and oauth for authentication. They had not learned these technologies in the time they were given and that was harming the team and that left me feeling frustrated. 
- Instead of expressing my frustration I took the initiative by scheduling more frequent meetings and assigning specific tasks for each member. I also took on tasks that they were not familiar with leaving them with tasks that they were familiar with. 
- Although it was a challenging time, I learned the importance of communication from the get go. By taking on more tasks I learned a lot more. This experience also helped me realize my ability to lead during difficult times. 
#### react vs angular
- During my capstone project, we encountered a disagreement when deciding on the technology stack for our frontend development. It wasn't a heated conflict, but rather a mismatch of opinions regarding whether we should use React or Angular.
- I advocated for Angular due to its comprehensive feature set. Angular provides everything out of the box, which means there’s no need to install third-party packages. It is particularly beneficial for beginners as it follows a more opinionated approach, preventing developers from deviating into bad practices. Additionally, Angular uses TypeScript and is compiled, which helps catch errors before they reach production.
- On the other hand, my teammates preferred React because they were already familiar with it and found functional components more convenient than class components. They valued the flexibility and simplicity that React offers, which they felt would make the development process smoother and faster given their existing knowledge.
- Although, I still believe Angular is the better choice, I recognized that learning a completely new framework could be inefficient and potentially delay our project. To resolve the disagreement, we decided to split our responsibilities based on our strengths. My partner and I focused on the backend and database, while the other two team members worked on the frontend using React. This way, we could all work efficiently and capitalize on our existing knowledge.
- This experience taught me the importance of flexibility and compromise in a team setting. By understanding and valuing my teammates’ perspectives, we were able to make a decision that benefited the entire project.

## a time you messed up or failed
#### calculus 3
- I was coming off a strong academic year—I had a 4.0 GPA, received an award for my academic performance, and I was feeling confident. I was taking calculus 3 that semester, I went into the first exam feeling like I didn’t need to study as much as usual, assuming it would be straightforward. I ended up barely passing that exam, which shook me. I promised myself I would prepare better next time.
- Then, just two weeks before the second exam, it was during the covid era, I unfortunately caught covid, and I missed several important lectures. Still, I had to take the exam without fully understanding the material, and I failed again. Having never failed a class before, I was panicking and I felt the pressure mounting on me. Still I was determined not to let this setback define my semester, I began visiting my professor, Dr. Grosh, every week for extra help. I worked through every exercise in the textbook, I made sure I fully understood the concepts.
- When it was time for the final, I went in as prepared as I could be, and it paid off, I scored really well. I finished the course with a C, it wasn’t the grade I’d hoped for, I was proud of it because it represented resilience and hard work. The next semester I went to look at my exam paper, Dr. Grosh told me I had earned the second-highest score on the final. This experience taught me that setbacks do not have to define my success and that I can always bounce back stronger.

## a time when you had to work in a team
#### capstone
- Let me tell you about my capstone project - it was actually one of my best experiences working in a team. There were four of us, and looking back, it's interesting how our team dynamics evolved throughout the project.
- At the beginning, we kept things pretty casual. We played to our strengths when dividing up the work - I paired up with another student to handle the backend and database stuff, while the other two focused on the frontend. Initially, we just had weekly meetings since the frontend and backend teams could kind of do their own thing at their own pace.
- But here's where it gets interesting - once we got deeper into the project and had to start integrating everything, things had to change. We couldn't just work in our separate bubbles anymore. We realized pretty quickly that meeting once a week wasn't cutting it, so we started having more frequent check-ins and really ramped up our communication between teams.
- What I really liked about our team was how we helped each other out. You know how it goes - sometimes someone wasn't totally familiar with a particular technology we were using, but instead of letting that slow us down, we'd step in and help each other learn. It made us stronger as a team.
- Oh, and for our final presentation, we had a neat approach - whoever built a feature was responsible for presenting it. I had developed this voice ordering feature, so I had to explain how it worked to people who weren't tech-savvy at all. It was actually a good challenge, having to break down something complex into simple terms that anyone could understand.
- The whole experience really showed me how a team needs to be flexible and adapt as a project evolves. Sometimes what works at the start isn't what you need later on, and that's okay as long as you're willing to adjust.
## fifa project
- During my application programming course in college, we had to develop an Android app as our main project. I partnered with another student, and since we both shared a passion for soccer and gaming, we decided to create a FIFA 22 player tracking app.
- Our goal was to build an app where users could browse FIFA 22 players, track their stats, and save their favorites. We needed to create a fully functional Android application with a clean user interface and backend within a semester
- I took ownership of the backend development while my teammate handled the frontend. For my part, I sourced player data from Kaggle, cleaned it up, and implemented an SQLite database to store everything. I also built multi-threading functionality to keep the app running smoothly while handling database operations.
- We set up two meetings every week to sync up on progress and tackle challenges together. The biggest hurdle we faced was dealing with Android's deprecated features since we were using Java instead of Kotlin. We actually decided to use Git for version control - it was our first time using it in a real project setting. Though we had some hiccups, like having to create a new repository after a major Git mistake, it taught us valuable lessons about collaborative development.
- What really made our partnership work was how we played to each other's strengths. While I focused on the data and logic, my teammate created a beautiful interface using Material Design principles and handled all the complex navigation.
- We successfully delivered a fully functional app and presented it to our class. The project not only met all the course requirements but also gave us real-world experience in team development. I learned a ton about database implementation and multi-threading, but more importantly, I gained practical experience with version control and collaborative development. Looking back, those Git mistakes actually helped us understand how real development teams work together.

## describe a time when you had to adapt to a new situation or environment
#### moving to new country
- I have had the unique experience of growing up in different countries, which required me to adapt to various new environments multiple times. I was born in Pakistan, and at a young age, my family moved to Nepal.
- In Nepal, I had to quickly learn a new language and adapt to a different culture and social norms. This was essential for integrating into my new school and community.
- To adapt, I immersed myself in the local language by taking additional classes and practicing with my peers. I also made an effort to understand and respect the cultural differences by participating in local traditions and social activities. This proactive approach helped me to communicate effectively and build friendships. Later, when we moved to the USA, I faced similar challenges of learning English and understanding American culture. I enrolled in English as a Second Language (ESL) classes, actively engaged in school activities, and sought out opportunities to interact with my classmates to better understand the cultural nuances.
- Through these experiences, I became fluent in multiple languages and developed a deep appreciation for different cultures. These skills have made adapting to new situations and environments second nature to me. This adaptability has also been beneficial in my professional life, allowing me to navigate and thrive in dynamic and multicultural work environments.

## took initiative / new idea
#### unique capstone project
 - So my team and I wanted to build this restaurant management system, but right off the bat, our advisor basically shut us down. He was like, 'Look, there are already tons of these systems out there - what makes yours different?'
- I was really passionate about this project and didn't want to give up on it. So I started thinking about the biggest challenge any new system faces - getting customers to actually use it. That's when I had this realization: instead of trying to convince individual customers to download yet another app, why not go straight to the restaurant owners? The idea was to set up kiosks or QR codes in restaurants, so customers would naturally use our system when ordering.
- To get restaurant owners on board, I focused on how we could help them optimize their staffing. My pitch was that by automating the ordering process, they could have their servers focus more on kitchen and counter operations instead of running back and forth to tables. But then our advisor raised another good point - he said people actually prefer talking to real servers rather than dealing with a phone or kiosk.
- That's when we came up with what I think was our most innovative idea: incorporating voice ordering to make it feel like you're still talking to a real person. When we presented this whole package to our advisor - the B2B approach, the staffing benefits, and the voice interface - he completely changed his tune. He went from skeptical to supportive, and we got the green light to move forward with the project.
- Looking back, it really showed me how taking initiative and responding constructively to criticism can turn a 'no' into a 'yes.' Instead of getting discouraged by the initial pushback, I used it as motivation to make our idea even better

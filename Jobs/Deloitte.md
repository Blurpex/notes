## tell me about yourself
- My passion for coding started when I began creating mods for Minecraft, which ultimately led me to pursue a degree in computer science which I recently obtained from Penn State.
- Over my time there, I earned several awards, most notably the IEEE hack-a-thon where I collaborated with a team of three to solve a mixture of software and hardware problems. Additionally, I received the President's Freshman award for outstanding academic performance in my first year.
- Throughout my studies, I worked on several projects, with my favorite being a restaurant management system. In this project I collaborated with a group of four to develop a solution to automating orders and reducing the need for servers, streamlining operations for small scale restaurants. On this project I focused on developing RESTful API's, developing schema for databases, and managing servers to host the application.
- Now I want to start my career in the software industry with the skills I have developed over time such as problem solving, detail oriented, and team work. Outside of work, I enjoy hiking, playing soccer, and give back to the community that has supported me through my journey.

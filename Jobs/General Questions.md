## tell me about yourself
- My passion for coding started when I began creating mods for Minecraft, which ultimately led me to pursue a degree in computer science which I recently obtained from Penn State.
- Over my time there, I earned several awards, most notably the IEEE hack-a-thon where I collaborated with a team of three to solve a mixture of software and hardware problems. Additionally, I received the President's Freshman award for outstanding academic performance in my first year.
- Throughout my studies, I worked on several projects, with my favorite being a restaurant management system. In this project I led a group of four to develop a solution to automate orders, reduce the need for servers, and streamline operations for small scale restaurants. On this project I focused on developing RESTful API's, developing schema for databases, and managing servers to host the application.
- Now I want to start my career in the software industry with the skills I have developed over time such as problem solving, detail oriented, and team work. Outside of work, I enjoy hiking, playing soccer, and giving back to the community that has supported me through my journey.

## how are you a good fit?
- As a recent graduate, my academic background has provided me with a strong foundation in computers and software. My studies have equipped me with essential skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving, and effective communication.
- Throughout my time in university, I worked on various projects that required collaboration and adaptability, allowing me to thrive in team environments. I also participated in hack-a-thons and Association for Computer Machinery where I developed my ability to learn quickly and tackle challenges.
- I am particularly drawn to the mission of the [company name] and I am eager to apply my knowledge and enthusiasm to contribute to the team. My commitment to continuous learning and growth, combined with my passion for computers, makes me excited about the opportunity to make a meaningful impact.

## goals
- I envision myself as a seasoned software developer—possibly even a senior developer—within the [insert] industry. I would like to take on larger project responsibilities and mentoring fellow developers. Additionally, I aspire to be the first in my family to earn a master’s degree, which would be a significant milestone.
- In the short term, my primary goal is to gain valuable experience and exposure in this field. I am actively seeking opportunities to enhance my skills and broaden my knowledge, positioning myself for long-term success.
- This role at the [company] would be instrumental in helping me achieve these goals. It would provide me with the opportunity to work on impactful projects, collaborate with experienced professionals, and develop the skills necessary to advance in my career while contributing to a mission that I am passionate about.

## time advice changed work significantly
- During my capstone project, I worked on a restaurant management system. Although I was proud of it, it was very similar to other products such as DoorDash and UberEats. Our advisor provided critical feedback, suggesting we add voice command capability to make our project more unique.
- Initially, I was uncertain about this direction, as it required us to learn natural language processing (NLP) and integrate speech to text services. However, I recognized the potential benefits and embraced the challenge. I took the lead in researching NLP and experimenting with voice commands.
- This advice resulted in a standout application that not only differentiated us in a competitive market but also significantly enhanced the user experience. Not only that I also learned a few new things that I otherwise would have not learned.
---
## biggest strength
- I would consider adaptability to be my biggest strength. I believe I can fit into new environments easily.
- For example, I grew up in different countries so I always had to adapt to new environments, learn new languages, and adapt to new cultures. Because of this I am proficient in five different languages.
- Also as a recent graduate, I am open to new opportunities and I can fit into any mold the company wants me to which I believe is a good fit for this role because you never know project I might be assigned.
---
## biggest weakness
 - I see my weaknesses as things I need to improve on, so the thing I need to improve the most on is public speaking. I tend to get nervous when addressing large audiences. I have taken a course on public speaking and effective speech which has significantly improved my ability to handle this anxiety.
 ---
## experience
- Although I don't have professional experience relevant to this role, I've gained experience through my projects, particularly in developing restaurant management system and a stock tracking platform. These projects have given me insight into working in a team environment , the software development lifecycle, and various technologies relevant to this role such as [insert technologies].

## walk me through your resume
- Sure I would be happy to walk you through my resume. I think its best if I went through it year by year starting from my freshman year at Penn State. I focused on introductory courses, the highlight of the year was learning Java and object oriented programming. One course that helped me out a lot was public speaking, it helped me communicate a lot better. That year, I received President's Freshman award for outstanding academic achievement. 
- In the sophomore year I tackled more complex courses like calculus, computer architecture, computer engineering, & data structures. I really liked the data structure class, it was the first course that went really deep into computer science. One topic that I really enjoyed was huffman encoding, which gave the idea to work on one of my projects text compression. Like the name suggests it reduces the size of the text files. The file size wasn't drastically reduced as a zip file would but I learned a lot such as low level programming techniques like bit operations & endian systems, different data structures such as dynamic arrays, binary heap, & linked list. 
- In the junior year, I declared computer science as my major and fully immersed myself in it. I attended hack-a-thon, which gave me valuable knowledge. One course that I enjoyed my junior year was android development which inspired me to develop the FIFA player tracker app.  Like the name says you can track soccer players, you can browse players, look at their stats, save your favorites players. In this project I gained hands-on experience with databases, particularly SQLite, multi threaded techniques, and advanced Java concepts such as anonymous classes, functional interfaces, lambdas, streams, etc. This project was the first one where I used git for version control. I also ditched windows to get used to linux and experiment with servers. Another course I enjoyed was netcentric, where I learned about different Javascript frameworks such as Angular and React, working with backend, APIs and much more. 
- My final year was the year where I learned the most by far. I took courses such as algorithms, compilers, artificial intelligence, machine learning, data mining, and software engineering. I also worked on capstone project, restaurant management system. I talked about it in my introduction, so I will skip it unless you want me to go into details about it. This year I tried my luck at hack-a-thon once again and ended up securing second place. 
- In may I graduated with a bachelors degree in computer science with a GPA of 3.5. and I consistently earned a place on the Dean's List throughout my academic journey. After graduation, I continued to enhance my skills by obtaining certifications in cloud computing from Amazon Web Services and in backend development in Spring from Udemy.

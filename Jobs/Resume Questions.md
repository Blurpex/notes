## work experience
#### snap my moments
 - I had the opportunity to work on a project for SnapMyMoments, a side business my friend started offering event services like photo booths and photography. He asked me to develop and manage his website.
- For this website, I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create a responsive and user-friendly site. I utilized Hostinger for web hosting and SSL certificate.
- I aligned the website with his vision and business needs. This experience not only allowed me to apply my technical skills but also reinforced my ability to create impactful digital solutions.

## projects
#### quick quisine
- This was my capstone project, I paired up with 3 of my friends and we planned to work on a restaurant management system. We got this idea from a McDonald's kiosk, its fully automatic and it reduces the staff needed to run a restaurant. But small scale restaurants cannot afford these expensive kiosks, so they have to rely on hiring someone or working doubly hard. 
- We created this full stack application where customers can order directly on their phone, skipping kiosks and servers. 
- We were a team of four, so we split up responsibilities with two members working on frontend with React, and me and my partner working on a Spring backend and a PostgreSQL database. We used other technologies as well such as Docker for containerization, Git and GitHub for collaboration, AWS S3 to store images, and EC2 to host the application. Specifically, I worked on developing RESTful and websocket API's, I developed schemas for databases, I set up the AWS infrastructure, and I also worked on authentication using OAuth2 protocol.
- As the project developed we realized that it was too similar to DoorDash and UberEats, so we started implementing data analytics into our project. We would collect the order history from a restaurant to make actionable insights such as most item sold on a specific day, total sales in a time range, are there more sales during breakfast or dinner time, and much more. The owners can use this report to grow their business.
- There were some concerns that people would prefer to speak to a server rather than order on a phone, so we implemented a voice ordering feature using natural language processing from GCP and OpenAI Whisper.
- We presented this project in front of people at the capstone conference and they were very enthusiastic about it and said they would be willing to use it, so we are working on refining it to turn it into a side business of ours.
#### fifa player tracker
- This was during junior year, I was taking Application Programming course, and we had to create an android app by the end of the semester, so I paired up with a friend of mine and we both liked soccer and video games, so we ended up making this. 
- Like the name says you can track soccer players, you can browse players, look at their stats, and save your favorites players. In this project I gained hands-on experience with databases, particularly SQLite, multi threaded techniques, and advanced Java concepts such as anonymous classes, functional interfaces, lambdas, and streams. This project was also the first one where I used Git and GitHub for version control. We also used Google's Material UI 3 to make the beautiful interface. 
#### text compression
- This project was a mix of coursework and self-interest. During my sophomore year, I was taking data structures, and one topic that I really enjoyed was Huffman encoding. Its basically assigning a string of binary numbers to characters, and the length of that string depended on how frequent the character appeared in a given text. 
- We just had learned the theory behind it, but I wanted to implement it. Previously, we had already implemented data structures such as binary heap, dynamic arrays, linked list, and hash maps from scratch, not using any standard libraries. So for this project, I combined all of those and implemented Huffman encoding on top of it.
- Then I took a random text file and ran it against my program, there was a little difference in the file size, but it was not as dramatic as a zip file. Regardless, I learned a lot about object oriented programming, and different data structures from this project.

## skills
- **Programming**: Among the programming languages I know, I am most familiar with Java, then JavaScript, some Python, HTML, CSS, and SQL. 
- **Frameworks**: I did a course from Udemy on Spring, and through that I learned about Spring & Hibernate. And I learned Angular and React through my coursework and projects.
- **Developer Tools**: I took an online course from University of Helsinki on Docker, but I did not go deep into it, I just know the basics. I am certified AWS cloud practitioner. I learned Git and GitHub through LinkedIn Learning, and I know Linux because its installed on my personal computer.

## tell me about yourself
- Back in high school I developed a passion for coding when I started tinkering with Minecraft code. This led me to pursue a degree in computer science which I recently obtained from Penn State.
- Over my time there I received multiple awards, one of the most prominent being IEEE hack-at-thon where we had to solve a mixture of software and hardware problems. Also during this time, I worked on several project, including my favorite restaurant management system where I collaborated with a group of 4 to develop a solution for small scale restaurants.
- Now I want to start my career as a software developer with the skills I have developed over time such as problem solving, detail oriented, and team work. Outside of work, I like to hike, play soccer, and give back to the community that has helped me through my journey.
## describe a difficult challenge
- One of the difficult challenges I faced was during my capstone project. Our team of four had split responsibilities, with two members focused on the frontend and my partner and I handling the backend. Initially, we took a relaxed approach to management, with everyone working at their own pace and only meeting once a week to discuss progress.
- As the deadline approached, I completed my tasks while my teammates struggled to keep up, which left me feeling frustrated. Instead of expressing my annoyance, I decided to take the initiative by scheduling more frequent meetings and assigning specific tasks for each session.
- Through these discussions, I discovered that my teammates were behind because they weren’t familiar with some of the technologies we were using, like OAuth for authentication and Stripe for payment processing, despite having time to learn. I took the opportunity to walk them through the implementation process.
- Although it was a challenging time, I learned the importance of communication and how stepping up can foster collaboration. This experience also helped me realize my ability to lead during difficult moments.
## what was your most significant accomplishment
- My biggest accomplishment is competing in hack-a-thon hosted by IEEE in spring semester. The first half of the competition was solving a set of algorithmic problems and the second half of the competition was working with circuits. I was a part of team of 3 where two of us were computer science majors, and one was from IST. Among us, I was the only one who had taken a single course in circuits. 
- On the competition day, we breezed through the first portion which was solving software problems since that was our specialization. The second portion, the circuit portion was more difficult since we had little experience in it. However, we did manage to be the first one to solve a mini task which was displaying the letters PSU one by one on a LED matrix. I personally was very proud of that.
- At the end my team finished second with just a few points behind the first team.
## how are you a good fit?
- As a recent graduate, my academic background has provided me with a strong foundation in computers and software. My studies have equipped me with essential skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving, and effective communication.
- Throughout my time in university, I worked on various projects that required collaboration and adaptability, allowing me to thrive in team environments. I also participated in hack-a-thons and Association for Computer Machinery where I developed my ability to learn quickly and tackle challenges.
- I am particularly drawn to the mission of the [company name] and I am eager to apply my knowledge and enthusiasm to contribute to the team. My commitment to continuous learning and growth, combined with my passion for computers, makes me excited about the opportunity to make a meaningful impact.
## goals
- I envision myself as a seasoned software developer—possibly even a senior developer—within the [insert] industry, taking on larger project responsibilities and mentoring fellow developers. Additionally, I aspire to be the first in my family to earn a master’s degree, which would be a significant milestone.
- In the short term, my primary goal is to gain valuable experience and exposure in this field. I am actively seeking opportunities to enhance my skills and broaden my knowledge, positioning myself for long-term success.
- This role at the [company] would be instrumental in helping me achieve these goals. It would provide me with the opportunity to work on impactful projects, collaborate with experienced professionals, and develop the skills necessary to advance in my career while contributing to a mission that I am passionate about.
## time advice changed work significantly
- During my capstone project, I worked on a restaurant management system. Although I was proud of it, it was very similar to other products such as DoorDash and UberEats. Our advisor provided critical feedback, suggesting we add voice command capability to make our project more unique.
- Initially, I was uncertain about this direction, as it required us to learn natural language processing (NLP) and integrate speech to text services. However, I recognized the potential benefits and embraced the challenge. I took the lead in researching NLP and experimenting with voice commands.
- This advice resulted in a standout application that not only differentiated us in a competitive market but also significantly enhanced the user experience. Not only that I also learned a few new things that I otherwise would have not learned.
## biggest strength
- I would consider flexibility to be my biggest strength. As a recent graduate, I am open to new opportunitiesI can fit into any mold the company wants me to, 
## biggest weakness
- I see my weaknesses as things I need to improve on, so the thing I need to improve the most on is public speaking. I tend to get nervous when addressing large audiences. I have taken public speaking course which has significantly improved my ability handle this anxiety. 
## experience
- Although I don't have professional experience relevant to this role, I've gained experience through my projects, particularly in developing restaurant management system and a stock tracking platform. These projects have given me insight into working in a team environment , the software development lifecycle, and various technologies relevant to this role such as [insert technologies].

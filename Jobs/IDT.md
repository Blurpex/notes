### tell me about a challenge you faced
- During our capstone project, our team initially adopted a relaxed management approach where everyone worked at their own pace. As we approached the deadline, I found myself nearly finished with the backend work while my teammates were falling behind. I admit I felt frustrated doing most of the heavy lifting.
- In response, I decided to step into a leadership role. I revamped our approach handing out tasks, giving deadlines, and, by increasing the frequency of team meetings. During these meetings, I discovered that some team members were struggling with the technology stack, which explained their slower progress.
- With my backend tasks almost complete, I took on more challenging responsibilities such as authentication and payment handling. And we were able to finish the project in time and by taking on difficult tasks, I learned a lot more.
- Leadership might not be my strongest suit, but I found that it comes naturally to me in difficult times.

### tell me about your past projects
- **restaurant management system** -> 
	- the idea behind this project was to target small scale restaurants with limited manpower by automating the ordering process
	- I worked with a team of 4 and we split the group in two groups - one working on backend and one on frontend. I was responsible for developing the backend
	- we used React as frontend, spring as backend, and postgres as the database
	- some specific things that I worked on was developing the REST API, setting up Amazon S3 to store images, stripe to handle payments, GCP to extract key entities from voice command, keycloak for oauth and openid, and linux server to host applications inside a docker container  
- **FIFA player tracker** ->
	- it has been a while since I worked on this project, i used sqllite and java to make this project, since then google has moved on from java to kotlin
	- basically its an android app that lets you look up player statistics from the FIFA 22 game
	- the most difficult part of the project was that since android follows a single threaded model, I had to implement multi threaded techniques
	- another problem was that android constantly deprecates stuff, so I had to constantly keep up with them 
- **text compression** -> 
	- this is self explanatory, I took a text file and reduced the size of that file using huffman encoding
	- the only challenge was that I did not allow myself to import any external libraries, so I had to code it from scratch, all I used was plain old java
	- i learned a lot about object oriented programming and data structures from this project

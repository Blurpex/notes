## experience working with a team
- During my capstone project, I led a four-person team in developing an innovative digital ordering solution for small-scale restaurants. Our goal was to help family-owned restaurants compete in the digital space without the overhead of traditional ordering systems or expensive third-party services.
- As the team lead, I was responsible for several critical technical components. I developed the RESTful APIs that formed the backbone of our service, designed the database schemas in PostgreSQL, and managed our cloud infrastructure on AWS. I also coordinated with team members to ensure our Spring backend integrated smoothly with our React frontend.
- What set our solution apart from competitors like DoorDash and Uber Eats was our focus on data analytics and user experience. We built features that provided restaurant owners with actionable insights, such as peak sales periods, best-selling items by day of the week, and trend analysis. To make the ordering process more intuitive, we implemented voice ordering functionality using natural language processing, simulating the experience of talking to a server.
- The solution was well-received during our final presentation, with many interested in using our product. This project not only demonstrated my technical capabilities but also my ability to lead a team, make architectural decisions, and deliver a market-ready product.
## What tools and/or strategies do you use to organize and prioritize your work to meet personal and team goals, expectations, and deliverables?

- Let me walk you through how I organized my work during my most recent experience leading the restaurant ordering system project.
- For version control and collaboration, we heavily relied on Git and GitHub. This was essential since we had multiple team members working on different parts of the system - from the React frontend to the Spring backend. We used feature branches to manage our development workflow, which helped us track changes and merge code efficiently without stepping on each other's toes.
- For team communication, we used Slack as our main platform. We had different channels set up for backend discussions, frontend updates, and general project coordination. This helped us keep conversations organized and made it easy to find information when we needed it.
- We also held regular team meetings to discuss progress, technical challenges, and next steps. These check-ins were particularly valuable when we were integrating different components of the system, like connecting our payment processing through Stripe or implementing the voice ordering feature.
- This combination of tools and regular communication helped us stay coordinated and deliver our project successfully.
## what do you want to work on?
- While I'm open to various roles, I believe my strongest fit would be in a data analyst position at Erie. Through my recent project experience, I discovered I really enjoy working with data and turning it into actionable insights.
- For example, in our restaurant ordering platform, one of the features I was most excited about was building the analytics dashboard. We took raw sales data and transformed it into valuable insights for restaurant owners - showing them trends like peak business hours, popular menu combinations, and seasonal patterns. I found it really satisfying to help businesses make better decisions through data.
- However, what matters most to me is the opportunity for growth and development. I'm early in my career and eager to learn. Whether that's diving deeper into data analytics, picking up new technical skills, or even exploring other areas like software development or business analysis - I'm genuinely interested in growing my skillset. I see Erie as a place where I could develop professionally while contributing meaningfully to the company's mission.
## In your perspective how is technology important?
- I have seen firsthand how technology can completely change the way business operate. Take my recent project as an example - we built a digital ordering system for small scale restaurants. Think about how restaurants typically work: servers running around with notepads, manually punching orders into register, and running paper tickets to the kitchen. It's slow, mistakes happen, and it requires a lot of staff.
- We flipped this old-school process on its head. With our system, customer places order directly through their phones, which go straight to the kitchen - no middle person needed. Plus, restaurant owners get really useful data they never had before, like which dished sell best on weekends or during dinner rush. Before, they were guessing about these things. 
- What I love most about technology is how it levels the playing field. Small family restaurants usually can't afford fancy ordering systems like big chains. But with our cloud-based solution, they got the same powerful tools at a fraction of the cost. When technology is used right, it helps businesses work smarter, not harder.
